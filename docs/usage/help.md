elbencho - A distributed benchmark for files, objects and blocks

Version: 3.0-27

Tests include throughput, IOPS and access latency. Live statistics show how the
system behaves under load and whether it is worth waiting for the end result.

Get started by selecting what you want to test...

Large shared files or block devices (e.g. streaming or random IOPS):
  $ elbencho <a href="help-large.md">--help-large</a>

Multiple dirs and files per thread (e.g. lots of small files):
  $ elbencho <a href="help-multi.md">--help-multi</a>

S3 object storage:
  $ elbencho <a href="help-s3.md">--help-s3</a>

Multiple clients (e.g. shared file systems):
  $ elbencho <a href="help-dist.md">--help-dist</a>

See all available options (e.g. csv file output):
  $ elbencho <a href="help-all.md">--help-all</a>

Happy benchmarking!
